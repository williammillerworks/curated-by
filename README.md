# curated.me

Product Vision
A minimalist, single-page web app for curating and sharing your favorite links with personal ratings. Think of it as a digital treasure chest where you collect the best things you find online, one link at a time.

Core Purpose

Collect and rate links you discover
Share your curated collection with others
Present everything in a clean, scannable format


Key Features
1. Add New Links

Simple form at the top of the page
Enter a URL
Select a star rating (1-5 stars) by clicking
Automatically fetches the webpage title
Option to rewrite/customize the title before saving
One-click submit

2. View Collection

Shows all your saved links in one list
Each item displays:

Title (original or customized)
Star rating (visual, not interactive)
Date added (MM.DD.YYYY format)


Listed in chronological order (newest first)

3. Manage Links

Delete any link from your collection
Title editing only during initial add process


Design Principles

Minimal & Modern: Clean like Claude or OpenAI interfaces
Breathing Room: Generous white space
Subtle Interactions: Gentle hover effects, smooth transitions
Typography-focused: Let the content shine
Distraction-free: No clutter, no noise


What This Is NOT (Out of Scope for Prototype)

No detail pages for individual links
No user accounts or login
No one-link-per-day limitation (adding later)
No social features or sharing buttons
No link preview images or favicons
No sorting or filtering options
No post-add title editing


Success Criteria
A simple, elegant prototype where you can:

Add a link with a rating in under 10 seconds
Quickly scan your entire collection
Feel good about sharing it with others
